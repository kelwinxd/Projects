    <p class="desc-egito">The <strong>origin of Easter</strong> begins in the book of Exodus, where the Hebrews were liberated from slavery in Egypt. This festival commemorates the passage of the angel of death, who spared the firstborn of the houses marked with the <strong>blood of the sacrificed lamb</strong>. Easter is a symbol of liberation, hope, and also a Law of God for the people of Israel.</p>

                Easter is entirely connected to the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God. His sacrifice on the cross offers redemption and spiritual liberation, akin to the Passover lamb of the Old Testament. His death and resurrection bring forgiveness, reconciliation with God, and hope of eternal life to the faithful.
